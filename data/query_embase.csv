Traditional indicators of sepsis exhibit poor performance when used in this unique population due to their underlying hypermetabolic and inflammatory response following burn injury. To address this challenge, we developed the Machine Intelligence Learning Optimizer (MILO), an automated machine learning (ML) platform, to automatically produce ML models for predicting burn sepsis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 211 adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with severe burn injury (≥ 20% total body surface area) to generate training and test datasets for ML applications. The MILO approach was compared against an exhaustive ""non-automated"" ML approach as well as standard statistical methods. For this study, traditional multivariate logistic regression (LR) identified seven predictors of burn sepsis when controlled for age and burn size (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.99-4.04, P = 0.032). The area under the ROC (ROC-AUC) when using these seven predictors was 0.88. Next, the non-automated ML approach produced an optimal model based on LR using 16 out of the 23 features from the study dataset. Model accuracy was 86% with ROC-AUC of 0.96. In contrast, MILO identified a k-nearest neighbor-based model using only five features to be the best performer with an accuracy of 90% and a ROC-AUC of 0.96. Machine learning augments burn sepsis prediction. MILO identified models more quickly, with less required features, and found to be analytically superior to traditional ML approaches. Future studies are needed to clinically validate the performance of MILO-derived ML models for sepsis prediction.",,,dimpylate,"burn, k nearest neighbor, proof of concept, sepsis","adult, article, artificial intelligence, body surface, controlled study, female, human, machine learning, major clinical study, male, prediction, retrospective study",,,,,,,,,English,English,,32704168,L632438802,10.1038/s41598-020-69433-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69433-w,,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"

Machine learning models built from data in electronic health records can be used as an effective tool for improving this timeliness, but so far, the potential for clinical implementations has been largely limited to studies in intensive care units. This study will employ a richer data set that will expand the applicability of these models beyond intensive care units. Furthermore, we will circumvent several important limitations that have been found in the literature: (1) Model evaluations neglect the clinical consequences of a decision to start, or not start, an intervention for sepsis. (2) Models are evaluated shortly before sepsis onset without considering interventions already initiated. (3) Machine learning models are built on a restricted set of clinical parameters, which are not necessarily measured in all departments. (4) Model performance is limited by current knowledge of sepsis, as feature interactions and time dependencies are hard-coded into the model. Methods: In this study, we present a model to overcome these shortcomings using a deep learning approach on a diverse multicenter data set. We used retrospective data from multiple Danish hospitals over a seven-year period. Our sepsis detection system is constructed as a combination of a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network. We assess model quality by standard concepts of accuracy as well as clinical usefulness, and we suggest a retrospective assessment of interventions by looking at intravenous antibiotics and blood cultures preceding the prediction time. Results: Results show performance ranging from AUROC 0.856 (3 h before sepsis onset) to AUROC 0.756 (24 h before sepsis onset). Evaluating the clinical utility of the model, we find that a large proportion of septic patients did not receive antibiotic treatment or blood culture at the time of the sepsis prediction, and the model could, therefore, facilitate such interventions at an earlier point in time. Conclusion: We present a deep learning system for early detection of sepsis that can learn characteristics of the key factors and interactions from the raw event sequence data itself, without relying on a labor-intensive feature extraction work. Our system outperforms baseline models, such as gradient boosting, which rely on specific data elements and therefore suffer from many missing values in our dataset.",,,,"deep learning, early diagnosis, electronic health record, sepsis (diagnosis)","adult, aged, antibiotic therapy, article, blood culture, clinical decision support system, comorbidity, convolutional neural network, early intervention, female, hospital admission, hospital mortality, human, intensive care unit, laboratory test, length of stay, long short term memory network, major clinical study, male, medical informatics, middle aged, multilayer perceptron, priority journal, vital sign",,,,,,,"Public Health, Social Medicine and Epidemiology (17), Internal Medicine (6)",,English,English,,32498999,L2005531297,10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101820,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101820,,"Copyright 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Materials and Methods: Using an ICU dataset of 13 728 records, we identify clinically significant sepsis subpopulations with distinct organ dysfunction patterns. We perform classification experiments with random forest, gradient boost trees, and support vector machines, using the identified subpopulations to distinguish patients who develop sepsis in the ICU from those who do not. Results: The classification results show that features selected using sepsis subpopulations as background knowledge yield a superior performance in distinguishing septic from non-septic patients regardless of the classification model used.

We have previously demonstrated that a machine-learning based algorithm (MLA) can accurately predict sepsis using only patient age and vital sign data. In a recent pivotal clinical trial, elevated monocytedistribution width (MDW) values were observed at 12 and 72 hours prior to development of clinical signs of sepsis (Sepsis-3). This study tests the hypothesis that including MDW and white blood cell count (WBC) data inputs will improve performance of an MLA for sepsis prediction. Methods: Four gradient boosted tree models (vital signs only, vitals + MDW, vitals + WBC, vitals + MDW + WBC) were trained on data from four hospitals. Vital signs were collected from electronic health records and included diastolic and systolic blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate. WBC and MDW data were collected using a Beckman Coulter DxH800 system. Sepsis was defined as meeting two SIRS criteria with microbial testing as defined in Rhee 2017. Vital sign only and vital sign + WBC models resulted in inclusion of 9918 patients, 10.2% of whom met sepsis criteria. MDW data resulted in the inclusion of 121 patients due to limited data availability, 14.0% of whom met criteria. Models were trained using 10-fold and leave one out cross-validation and evaluated on a holdout test set. Results: While Negative Predictive Value (NPV) performance held nearly constant near 0.9, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) increased from 0.75 for vitals only, to 0.86 for vitals + WBC, 0.92 for vitals + MDW, and 0.96 with the inclusion of vitals, MDW, and WBC. For comparison, the MEWS PPV was 0.46 and SOFA was 0.19, both with NPV near 0.9. Across all feature sets, models produced an AUROC>0.95. Specificity increased with WBC and MDW data inclusions. Conclusions: Results indicate that an MLA trained on vital signs together with WBC and MDW laboratory results can produce improved performance over current sepsis prediction methods. An adaptable MLA with the flexibility to evaluate the inclusion of new sepsis biomarkers has the potential for far-reaching impacts on sepsis treatment and patient outcomes.

In this prospective clinical outcomes study, we tested the hypothesis that the use of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) for severe sepsis detection and prediction would result in reductions in SIRS-related clinical outcomes. Our MLA was evaluated for patient outcomes using real world data from patient Electronic Health Records (EHRs) at nine diverse hospitals. Methods: A clinical outcomes before and after evaluation was performed on a prospective multiyear, multicenter clinical data set containing 75,147 patient encounters from nine hospitals. Mortality, hospital length of stay, and 30-day readmission analysis were performed for 17,758 adult patients who met two or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria at any point during their stay. We used the two-proportion risk difference z-test to determine the statistical significance of the decrease of in-hospital mortality or 30-day readmission rate with the use of the MLA. All tests were two-tailed with an alpha level of 0.05, and were performed using Python. This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID #NCT03960203), and has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at Pearl Pathways (IRB #19-DAS-111). Results: Use of the MLA was associated with a 39.5% reduction of in-hospital mortality (P<.001), a 32.3% reduction in length of stay (P<.001), and a 22.7% reduction in thirty-day readmissions (P<.001). The average length of stay reduction was found to be 1.56 days (see Figure 1). Conclusions: These results support that the implementation of an accurate machine learning algorithm for early sepsis recognition may lead to improved patient outcomes, and by extension may serve to reduce the financial burden to the US healthcare system. At an average per diem cost of care of $2,271 with 343 patients included per month at the nine locations, the reduction of length of stay translates to approximately $14.5 million of annual cost savings across all nine hospitals included in this analysis.

Date of Publication: 1 Dec 2019,58,S 02,e43,e57,1 Dec 2019,,,,,2511-705X (electronic),,NLM (Medline),"BACKGROUND: The design of computerized systems able to support automated detection of threatening conditions in critically ill patients such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis has been fostered recently. The increase of research work in this area is due to both the growing digitalization in health care and the increased appreciation of the importance of early sepsis detection and intervention. To be able to understand the variety of systems and their characteristics as well as performances, a systematic literature review is required. Existing reviews on this topic follow a rather restrictive searching methodology or they are outdated. As much progress has been made during the last 5 years, an updated review is needed to be able to keep track of current developments in this area of research. OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview about current approaches for the design of clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) in the context of SIRS, sepsis, and septic shock, and to categorize and compare existing approaches. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Searches for eligible articles were conducted on five electronic bibliographic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, Embase, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. Initial results were screened independently by two reviewers based on clearly defined eligibility criteria. A backward as well as an updated search enriched the initial results. Data were extracted from included articles and presented in a standardized way. Articles were classified into predefined categories according to characteristics extracted previously. The classification was performed according to the following categories: clinical setting including patient population and mono- or multicentric study, support type of the system such as prediction or detection, systems characteristics such as knowledge- or data-driven algorithms used, evaluation of methodology, and results including ground truth definition, sensitivity, and specificity. All results were assessed qualitatively by two reviewers. RESULTS: The search resulted in 2,373 articles out of which 55 results were identified as eligible. Over 80% of the articles describe monocentric studies. More than 50% include adult patients, and only four articles explicitly report the inclusion of pediatric patients. Patient recruitment often is very selective, which can be observed from highly varying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The task of disease detection is covered in 62% of the articles; prediction of upcoming conditions in 33%. Sepsis is covered in 67% of the articles, SIRS as sole entity in only 4%, whereas 27% focus on severe sepsis and/or septic shock. The most common combinations of categories ""algorithm used"" and ""support type"" are knowledge-based detection of sepsis and data-driven prediction of sepsis. In evaluations, manual chart review (38%) and diagnosis coding (29%) represent the most frequently used ground truth definitions; most studies present a sample size between 10,001 and 100,000 cases (31%) and performances highly differ with only five articles presenting sensitivities and specificities above 90%; four of them using knowledge-based rather than machine learning algorithms. The presentations of holistic CDSS approaches, including technical implementation details, system interfaces, and data and interoperability aspects enabling the use of CDSS in routine settings are missing in nearly all articles. CONCLUSIONS: The review demonstrated the high variety of research in this context successfully. A clear trend is observable toward the use of data-driven algorithms, and a lack of research could be identified in covering the pediatric population as well as acknowledging SIRS as an independent and threatening condition. The quality as well as the significance of the presented evaluations for assessing the performances of the algorithms in clinical routine settings are often not meeting the current standard of scientific work. Our future interest will be concentrated on these realistic settings by implementing and evaluating SIRS detection approaches as well as considering factors to make the CDSS useable in clinical routine from both technical and medical perspectives.",,,,"clinical decision support system, critical illness","age distribution, algorithm, human, knowledge base, publication, sample size, septic shock (diagnosis)",,,,,,,,,English,English,,31499571,L629267756,10.1055/s-0039-1695717,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1695717,,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"

INTERVENTIONS: A random-forest classifier, derived and validated using electronic health record data, was deployed both silently and later with an alert to notify clinical teams of sepsis prediction. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULT: Patients identified for training the algorithm were required to have International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition codes for severe sepsis or septic shock and a positive blood culture during their hospital encounter with either a lactate greater than 2.2 mmol/L or a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. The algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity of 26% and specificity of 98%, with a positive predictive value of 29% and positive likelihood ratio of 13. The alert resulted in a small statistically significant increase in lactate testing and IV fluid administration. There was no significant difference in mortality, discharge disposition, or transfer to ICU, although there was a reduction in time-to-ICU transfer.

Since the clinical presentation and characteristics of sepsis immediately after HCT can be different from that seen in general population or those who are receiving non-HCT chemotherapy, detecting early signs of sepsis in HCT recipients becomes critical. Herein, we extended our earlier analyses (Dadwal et al. ASH 2018) and evaluated a consecutive case series of 1806 patients who underwent HCT at City of Hope (2014-2017) to develop a machine-learning sepsis prediction model for HCT recipients, namely Early Sepsis Prediction/Identification for Transplant Recipients (ESPRIT) using variables within the Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. The primary clinical event was sepsis diagnosis within 100 days post-HCT, identified based on the use of the institutional “sepsis management order set” and mention of “sepsis” in the progress notes. The time of sepsis order set was considered as time of sepsis for the analyses. Data from 2014 to 2016 (108 visits with and 1315 visits without sepsis, 8% sepsis prevalence) were used as the training set and data from 2017 (24 visits with and 359 visits without sepsis, 6.6% sepsis prevalence) were kept as the holdout dataset for testing the model. From each patient visit, 61 variables were collected with a total of 862,009 lab values, 3,284,561 vital sign values and 249,982 medication orders for 1806 visits over the duration of HCT hospitalization (median: 24.1 days, range: 7-304). An ensemble of 100 random forest classification models were used to develop the prediction model. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) imputation was done to attribute the missing values with the last observed value of that variable. For model development and optimization, we applied a 5-fold stratified cross validation on the training dataset. Variable importance for the 100 models was assessed using Gini mean decrease accuracy method value, which was averaged to produce the final variable importance. HCT was autologous in 798 and allogeneic in 1008 patients. Ablative conditioning regimen was delivered to 97.3% and 38.3% of patients in autologous and allogeneic groups, respectively. When the impact of “sepsis” was analyzed as a time-dependent variable, sepsis development was associated with increased mortality (HR=2.79, 95%CI: 2.14-3.64, p<0.001) by multivariable Cox regression model. Retrospective evaluation at 0, 4, 8 and 12 hours pre-sepsis showed area under the ROC curves (AUCs) of 0.98, 0.91, 0.90 and 0.85, respectively (Fig 1a), outperforming the widely used Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) (Fig 1b). We then simulated our ESPRIT's performance in the unselected real-world data by running the model every hour from admit to sepsis or discharge, whichever occurred first. This process created an hourly risk score from admit to sepsis or discharge. ESPRIT achieved an AUC of 0.83 on the training and AUC of 0.82 on the holdout test dataset (Fig 2). An example of risk over time for a septic patient that was identified by the model with 27 hours lead time at threshold of 0.6 is shown in Fig 3. With at risk threshold of 0.6 (sensitivity: 0.4, specificity: 0.93), ESPRIT had a median lead time of 35 and 47 hours on training and holdout test data, respectively. This model allows users to select any threshold (with specific false positive/negative rate expected for a given population) to be used for specific purposes. For example, a red flag can be assigned to a patient when the risk passes the threshold of 0.6. At this threshold the false positive rate is only 7% and true positive rate is 40%. Then a yellow flag can be assigned at the threshold of 0.4, with which the model has higher (38%) false positive rate but also a high (90%) true positive rate. Using this two-step assessment/intervention system (red flag as an alarm and yellow flag as a warning sign to examine the patient to rule out sepsis), the model would achieve 90% sensitivity and 93% specificity in practice and overcome the low positive predictive value due to the rare incidence of sepsis. In summary, we developed and validated a novel machine learning monitoring system for sepsis prediction in HCT recipients. Our data strongly support further clinical validation of the ESPRIT model as a method to provide real-time sepsis predictions, and timely initiation of preemptive antibiotics therapy according to the predicted risks in the era of EHR.",,,antibiotic agent,"graft recipient, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, prediction, random forest, sepsis","adult, animal experiment, animal model, case study, conference abstract, dependent variable, diagnostic test accuracy study, drug therapy, electronic health record, female, hospitalization, incidence, male, mortality, nonhuman, predictive value, prevalence, receiver operating characteristic, retrospective study, risk assessment, running, sensitivity and specificity, simulation, validation process, vital sign",,,,,,,,,English,English,,,L630316058,10.1182/blood-2019-130926,http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2019-130926,,"Copyright 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Despite evidence that early initiation of treatment improves outcomes, rapid detection is challenging. Compliance with the CMS SEP-1 sepsis bundle is a nationally reported metric and will impact hospital reimbursements. Performance overall is poor with some reporting compliance at 33%. While the translational pathway for prognostic models has been well characterized, few machine learning models have been externally validated. This study aims to be the first deep learning model that is integrated into an operational workflow to successfully detect sepsis in real-time. The primary outcome is SEP-1 bundle compliance and secondary outcomes include inpatient mortality, hospital and emergency department (ED) length of stay, as well as process measures such as time from ED arrival identification of “time zero” (as defined by SEP-1) and time to bundle completion. Methods: March, 2016, an interdisciplinary team consisting of clinicians, data scientists and machine learning experts at a large academic medical center embarked on an innovation pilot to develop a novel machine learning model to detect sepsis, named Sepsis Watch (SW). A computable sepsis definition and deep learning model were developed using a curated dataset capturing over 43,000 inpatient admissions between 10/1/2014 – 12/31/2015. Ten sepsis definitions were compared and clinicians agreed on the following: >= 2 SIRS criteria, blood culture order, and end organ damage. A deep learning model was built to predict which patients would meet that phenotype of sepsis. The model incorporates 121 clinical variables that are continually collected and assessed in real time on every patient that presents to the ED and the first 6 hours of inpatient admission if applicable. Patient status is updated as being “low risk,” “medium risk,” “high risk,” or “septic.” If Sepsis Watch predicts a patient to be “High risk” or “septic” that information is communicated to the ED team. Data collected for operational feedback includes total volume of patients who are deemed “High Risk” or “septic”, time of day when the model made these predictions, compliance with antibiotic administration, collection of repeat lactate and obtaining cultures all within 3 hours both individually and as a bundle. Results: Sepsis Watch operated in the pilot phase 11/06/18 – 05/05/19 and analyzed over 39,000 ED patients for their risk of sepsis. It predicted that 1,318 patients were “high risk.” Of those, 948 progressed to “septic” either in the ED or within 6 hours of admission. Bundle compliance within 3 hours was tracked. For those who were “High Risk” but never “septic,” 77% had antibiotics administered, 75% had a repeat lactate collected and 72% had cultures collected in 3 hours. For those deemed “septic”, 79% had antibiotics administered within 3 hours, 90% had a repeat lactate collected in 3 hours and 88% had cultures collected in 3 hours. Overall bundle compliance was 55.7% for “High Risk” patients and 67.1% for “Septic” patients. Conclusions: Sepsis Watch is the first deep learning model deployed to successfully detect sepsis in real time with operational workflows developed provide support directly to emergency physicians. Preliminary data suggests that Sepsis Watch has improved compliance with SEP-1.

This insight makes accurate models for early prediction of sepsis a key task in machine learning for healthcare. Previous approaches have achieved high AUROC by learning from electronic health records where sepsis labels were defined automatically following established clinical criteria. We argue that the practice of incorporating the clinical criteria that are used to automatically define ground truth sepsis labels as features of severity scoring models is inherently circular and compromises the validity of the proposed approaches. We propose to create an independent ground truth for sepsis research by exploiting implicit knowledge of clinical practitioners via an electronic questionnaire which records attending physicians’ daily judgements of patients’ sepsis status. We show that despite its small size, our dataset allows to achieve state-of-the-art AUROC scores.

When all hospital deaths are considered nearly 35% are attributable to sepsis. In a previous study, Nemati et al. developed the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert (AISE), a machine learning algorithm that predicts sepsis (defined according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines) in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients 4-6 hours prior to clinical suspicion with an AUC of 0.85. Significant differences in patient comorbidities and primary diagnoses in specialized ICUs (e.g. medical vs. surgical) has compelled many to create unit-specific models for prediction; however, research into “generalizable” models for prediction has suggested that this approach may not be necessary. Methods: A cohort of 43,417 ICU patients who develop sepsis during their ICU admission from four separate hospitals in a single health system between 1/1/14-6/30/17 is examined. All ICUs were placed into one of the following categories: medical (MICU), surgical (SICU), or other (Other). AISE was trained on a cohort from each of the aforementioned categories, and its performance at locations different from the training location was examined. Next, the performance of unit specific versions of AISE was compared to a single model for all patients that included a feature indicating the patient's ICU category (MICU, SICU, Other). Sensitivity was set at 0.85 and specificity of individual models was compared. 10-fold cross-validation (80%/20% split) was performed and is reported as median [interquartiles] in Table 1. Results: Incidence of sepsis in the MICU, SICU, or Other patients was 23.3%, 18.4%, and 12.0% respectively, and the average Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was highest in SICU patients at 2.5. Performance of the All ICU model was as good as or better than a unit-specific model. Specificity of the AISE model on all ICU data was 0.701, and the specificity for AISE in the MICU, SICU, and Other ICUs were 0.672, 0.683, 0.759 respectively. Conclusions: Performance of ICU specific models of AISE is not greater than a generalized model that is developed on a larger cohort of all patients. Future sepsis prediction models need to balance the performance improvements that are realized with very large data sets with the cost of selecting smaller cohorts to create tailored models. This work demonstrates that models need only include the patient's ICU type as a covariate during development and can forgo the added complexity of creating unit-specific models.

Specifically, we develop a multi-layer machine learning approach to analyze continuous, high-frequency data. We illustrate the capabilities of this approach for early identification of patients at risk of sepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection, using high-frequency (minute-by-minute) physiological data collected from bedside monitors. In our analysis of a cohort of 586 patients, the model obtained from analyzing the output of a previously developed sepsis prediction model resulted in improved outcomes. Specifically, the original model failed to predict 11.76 ± 4.26% of sepsis patients earlier than Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, commonly used to identify patients at risk for rapid physiological deterioration resulting from sepsis. In contrast, the multi-layer model only failed to predict 3.21 ± 3.11% of sepsis patients earlier than SIRS. In addition, sepsis patients were predicted on average 204.87 ± 7.90 minutes earlier than SIRS criteria using the multi-layer model, which can potentially help reduce mortality and morbidity if implemented in the ICU.",,,,"computer prediction, sepsis","acute heart infarction, algorithm, article, blood pressure cuff, breathing rate, cardiovascular disease, decision tree, diastolic blood pressure, health care system, heart failure, heart rate, hospitalization, human, ICD-10, learning algorithm, leukocyte count, machine learning, major clinical study, mean arterial pressure, measurement accuracy, morbidity, mortality, risk factor, sensitivity and specificity, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, systolic blood pressure, time series analysis",,,,,,,"Biophysics, Bioengineering and Medical Instrumentation (27), Clinical and Experimental Biochemistry (29), Internal Medicine (6)",,English,English,,30676988,L627527562,10.1109/JBHI.2019.2894570,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2019.2894570,,"Copyright 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

It implies a spectrum of illness severity that confers high mortality rates and societal cost. Early identification of sepsis with appropriate management reduces mortality and has been the focus of numerous hospital-quality metrics. The application of machine learning approaches to sepsis prediction has the potential to improve model performance, but requires data rich environments, such as the intensive care unit (ICU). We applied a novel machine learning approach to predict sepsis 6-hours ahead of meeting diagnostic criteria in non-ICU patients using limited density data. METHODS: Included patients were admitted to a general hospital ward at a large, academic, tertiary referral center for at least 12 hours between 2012 and 2017. All demographic, medication, vital sign and laboratory information was obtained from the electronic health record and used to identify time of onset and generate model features. Sepsis was identified by 2 or more of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria and a suspicion of infection. The negative cohort was randomly subsampled at a ratio of 2:1. The predictive model was generated, trained, and evaluated using 5-fold cross validation with a 20% held-out test set. RESULTS: In total, 643 patients met sepsis inclusion criteria. Patients that developed sepsis were more likely to be male (53.5% vs 42.7% p<0.01), have chronic kidney disease (22.7% vs 13.5% p<0.01), and coronary artery disease (15.9% vs 7.4% p<0.01). Septic patients also had longer lengths of stay (14.4 vs 3.5 days p<0.01), higher rates of ICU transfer (25.51% vs 0.31%, p<0.01), and higher rates of inpatient mortality (5.60% vs 0.47% p<0.01). Thirty-nine features were used for predictive modeling. At 6 hours ahead of meeting diagnostic criteria, the model had a 5-fold cross validation mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.79 and a 20% test set AUROC of 0.81 (Figure 1). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a machine learning sepsis prediction model that was able to identify a priori a population of ward patients at risk for a prolonged length of stay, transfer to an ICU and higher rate of mortality. At 6 hours ahead of meeting diagnostic criteria, this model was able to accurately predict sepsis in non-ICU patients using limited density data. Iterative model development with further feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization are needed before prospective analyses can be deployed.

An innovative and feasible tool for predicting sepsis remains elusive. However, early and accurate prediction of sepsis could help physicians with proper treatments and minimize the diagnostic uncertainty. Machine learning models could help to identify potential clinical variables and provide higher performance than existing traditional low-performance models. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of observational studies to quantify the performance of a machine learning model to predict sepsis. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted through the electronic database (e.g. PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, EMBASE, etc.) between January 1, 2000, and March 1, 2018. All the studies published in English and reporting the sepsis prediction using machine learning algorithms were considered in this study. Two authors independently extracted valuable information from the included studies. Inclusion and exclusion of studies were based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: A total of 7 out of 135 studies met all of our inclusion criteria. For machine learning models, the pooled area under receiving operating curve (SAUROC) for predicting sepsis onset 3 to 4 h before, was 0.89 (95%CI: 0.86–0.92); sensitivity 0.81 (95%CI:0.80–0.81), and specificity 0.72 (95%CI:0.72–0.72) whereas the pooled SAUROC for SIRS, MEWS, and SOFA was 0.70, 0.50, and 0.78.

Achieving accurate prediction of sepsis detection moment based on bedside monitor data in the intensive care unit (ICU). A good clinical outcome is more probable when onset is suspected and treated on time, thus early insight of sepsis onset may save lives and reduce costs. Methodology. We present a novel approach for feature extraction, which focuses on the hypothesis that unstable patients are more prone to develop sepsis during ICU stay. These features are used in machine learning algorithms to provide a prediction of a patient's likelihood to develop sepsis during ICU stay, hours before it is diagnosed. Results. Five machine learning algorithms were implemented using R software packages. The algorithms were trained and tested with a set of 4 features which represent the variability in vital signs. These algorithms aimed to calculate a patient's probability to become septic within the next 4 hours, based on recordings from the last 8 hours. The best area under the curve (AUC) was achieved with Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial basis function, which was 88.38%. Conclusions. The high level of predictive accuracy along with the simplicity and availability of input variables present great potential if applied in ICUs.

SETTING: Academic medical center from January 2013 to December 2015. PATIENTS: Over 31,000 admissions to the ICUs at two Emory University hospitals (development cohort), in addition to over 52,000 ICU patients from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III ICU database (validation cohort). Patients who met the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis (Sepsis-3) prior to or within 4 hours of their ICU admission were excluded, resulting in roughly 27,000 and 42,000 patients within our development and validation cohorts, respectively.None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High-resolution vital signs time series and electronic medical record data were extracted. A set of 65 features (variables) were calculated on hourly basis and passed to the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours (where T = 12, 8, 6, or 4). Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert was used to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours and to produce a list of the most significant contributing factors. For the 12-, 8-, 6-, and 4-hour ahead prediction of sepsis, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic in the range of 0.83-0.85. Performance of the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert on the development and validation cohorts was indistinguishable.

The clinical presentation and characteristics of sepsis immediately after HCT can be different from that in general population or those who are receiving non-HCT chemotherapy: detecting early signs of sepsis in HCT recipients becomes critical. Herein, we developed and validated a machine-learning based sepsis prediction model for patients who underwent HCT at our center, using variables within the Electronic Health Record (EMR) data. We evaluated a consecutive case series of 317 adult patients who underwent autologous (n = 136) or allogeneic (n = 181) HCT at our center between 2011 and 2015. The median age at the time of HCT was 55 (range: 18-77). The primary clinical event for this analysis was sepsis diagnosis within 100 days post-HCT, which was observed in 34 patients (11%-Figure 1). Sepsis-like symptoms associated with neutropenic fever or other febrile illnesses developed in 29 patients (9%). We applied a Survival Random Forest model and built a predictive algorithm with multiple time-varying variables. In addition to age, race, gender, weight, transplant type, conditioning intensity, disease risk index, HCTCI and diagnosis, patients' blood calcium, glucose, ferritin, creatinine level, lymphocyte percentage, platelet, WBC count, heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, Spo2 and respiratory rate were monitored between days -30 and +100 to detect differentiating patterns between septic and non-septic patients (Figure 2). Our survival-analysis based system incorporated a time-series data, taking into account subtle changes of variables over time, seasonality in data and censoring. Using stratified 10-fold cross validation, the data was divided to training and testing sets 10 times. The model was trained using the training data set and validated using the testing set. The reported performance measures are the mean of the 10 different results. The model also uses a sliding window to retrain and improve itself as new data became available over time. Also, performance of machine learning algorithm has direct relationship with training data size. With area under the curve (AUC) of.88, sensitivity of.81 and specificity of.76 (Figure 3); our model significantly outperforms widely used Modified EarlyWarning Score (MEWS), which has AUC of.73 on general population.

Methods have been developed to electronically monitor patients for severe sepsis, but few have provided predictive capabilities to enable early intervention. We hypothesize, patient length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality rate decrease with the use of a machine learning-based severe sepsis prediction algorithm in the intensive care unit. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted at two mixed medical-surgical intensive care units at UCSF from December 2016 to February 2017. This factorial, open label trial was designed to test whether InSight®, a machine learning-based severe sepsis prediction algorithm, was better than the current Electronic Health Record (EHR)-based severe sepsis detection system. All adult patients (18+) admitted to the participating units were eligible for study. Enrolled patients were automatically assigned to a trial arm according to a random allocation sequence. Participants randomized to the experimental group were screened by InSight and the existing severe sepsis detection method. Using only the most commonly recorded measurements in the electronic health record, primarily vital signs and age, Insight predicted sepsis onset and alerted the appropriate care team. Upon receiving an alert from the prediction algorithm, the care team evaluated the patient for severe sepsis and initiated the severe sepsis bundle, if appropriate. The primary outcome was LOS. The secondary outcome was in-hospital mortality rate. Results: Outcomes (75 control patients, 67 experimental) were analyzed. There was a significant (P = .04) decrease in hospital LOS (13 d vs. 10.3 d) and a 58.0% reduction in in-hospital mortality rate when using Insight (21.3% vs 8.96%), (P = .02).

Early detection of pediatric sepsis may improve patient outcomes and reduce spending. We have developed and validated a machine learning algorithm for early detection and prediction of pediatric severe sepsis using patient EHR data. Methods: Boosted ensembles of decision trees were used to create the sepsis prediction classifier. The algorithm was trained using de-identified EHR data from 11,127 pediatric (aged between 2 and 17 years) inpatient encounters at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center. The algorithm was trained and tested for severe sepsis detection at onset and severe sepsis prediction at 4 hours before onset. Sepsis risk prediction scores were computed using patient measurements for patient age, diastolic and systolic blood pressures, heart rate, temperature, respiration rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation; optionally, the algorithm incorporated measurements for Glasgow Coma Score, white blood cell count, and platelet count when they were available in the dataset. We performed four-fold cross validation of the algorithm, and algorithm performance was compared to that of the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score (PELOD-2) and pediatric SIRS. Positive severe sepsis cases were identified in the dataset as patients with all of a SIRS ≥ 2 (where at least one of temperature and white blood cell count is abnormal); an ICD-9 code for septicemia, sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock in the patient chart; and organ dysfunction. Results: The machine learning algorithm achieved a mean Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.912 (standard error: ±0.023) for sepsis detection at onset, and a mean AUROC of 0.727 (standard error ± 0.052) for prediction 4 hours before onset. Pediatric SIRS demonstrated AUROCs of 0.742 for onset detection and 0.667 for 4 hour prediction, and PELOD-2 demonstrated AUROC of 0.881 for onset detection and 0.658 for 4 hour prediction. The machine learning algorithm had a higher diagnostic odds ratio than both PELOD-2 and SIRS for both severe sepsis detection and prediction, and maintained concurrently high sensitivity and specificity for onset detection (Table 1).

We evaluate robustness to missing data, customisation to site-specific data using transfer learning and generalisability to new settings. Design A machine-learning algorithm with gradient tree boosting. Features for prediction were created from combinations of six vital sign measurements and their changes over time. Setting A mixed-ward retrospective dataset from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Medical Center (San Francisco, California, USA) as the primary source, an intensive care unit dataset from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, Massachusetts, USA) as a transfer-learning source and four additional institutions' datasets to evaluate generalisability.

Primary and secondary outcome measures Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for detection and prediction of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. Results For detection of sepsis and severe sepsis, InSight achieves an AUROC curve of 0.92 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.93) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.88), respectively. Four hours before onset, InSight predicts septic shock with an AUROC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.98) and severe sepsis with an AUROC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.91). Conclusions InSight outperforms existing sepsis scoring systems in identifying and predicting sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. This is the first sepsis screening system to exceed an AUROC of 0.90 using only vital sign inputs. InSight is robust to missing data, can be customised to novel hospital data using a small fraction of site data and retains strong discrimination across all institutions.",,,,"sepsis, vital sign","adult, article, California, emergency ward, female, general ward, human, intensive care unit, machine learning, major clinical study, male, multicenter study, retrospective study, septic shock, validation study, ward",,,,,,,"Public Health, Social Medicine and Epidemiology (17), Anesthesiology (24), Internal Medicine (6)",,English,English,20180627257,29374661,L623794227,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017833,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017833,,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

For each hour treatment initiation is delayed after diagnosis, sepsis-related mortality increases by approximately 8%. Therefore, maximizing effective care requires early recognition and initiation of treatment protocols. Antecedent signs and symptoms of sepsis can be subtle and unrecognizable (e.g., loss of autonomic regulation of vital signs), causing treatment delays and harm to the patient. In this work we investigated the utility of high-resolution blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) times series dynamics for the early prediction of sepsis in patients from an urban, academic hospital, meeting the third international consensus definition of sepsis (sepsis-III) during their ICU admission. Using a multivariate modeling approach we found that HR and BP dynamics at multiple time-scales are independent predictors of sepsis, even after adjusting for commonly measured clinical values and patient demographics and comorbidities. Earlier recognition and diagnosis of sepsis has the potential to decrease sepsis-related morbidity and mortality through earlier initiation of treatment protocols.",,,,"diastolic blood pressure, heart rate variability, patient care, sepsis, systolic blood pressure","adult, article, cohort analysis, comorbidity, controlled study, female, hospital admission, hospitalization, human, intensive care unit, major clinical study, male, morbidity, mortality, prediction, priority journal, urban area",,,,,,,"Public Health, Social Medicine and Epidemiology (17), Cardiovascular Diseases and Cardiovascular Surgery (18)",,English,English,20170648897,28916175,L618271265,10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2017.08.013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2017.08.013,,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Methods have been developed to electronically monitor patients for severe sepsis, but few have provided predictive capabilities to enable early intervention.Hypothesis: Patient length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality rate decrease with the use of a machine learning-based severe sepsis prediction algorithm in the intensive care unit.Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted at two mixed medical-surgical intensive care units at UCSF from December 2016 to February 2017. This factorial, open label trial was designed to test whether InSight®, a machine learning-based severe sepsis prediction algorithm, was better than the current Electronic Health Record (EHR)-based severe sepsis detection system. All adult patients (18+) admitted to the participating units were eligible for study. Enrolled patients were automatically assigned to a trial arm according to a random allocation sequence. Participants randomized to the experimental group were screened by InSight and the existing severe sepsis detection method. Using only the most commonly recorded measurements in the electronic health record, primarily vital signs and age, Insight predicted sepsis onset and alerted the appropriate care team. Results: The primary outcome was LOS. The secondary outcome was in-hospital mortality rate. Outcomes (75 control patients, 67 experimental) were analyzed. There was a significant (P = .04) decrease in hospital LOS (13 d vs. 10.3 d) and a 58.0% reduction in in-hospital mortality rate when using Insight (21.3% vs 8.96%), (P = .02). No adverse events were reported during this trial.Conclusions: A machine learning-based sepsis prediction tool may improve patient outcomes and decrease sepsisrelated costs.",,,,"length of stay, machine learning, overall survival, prediction, sepsis","adult, adverse event, controlled study, early intervention, electronic health record, female, hospital mortality, human, major clinical study, male, open study, randomization, randomized controlled trial, surgical intensive care unit, vital sign",,,,,,,,,English,English,,,L619983355,,,,"Copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
