Pre-clinical research using an equine sepsis model identified a panel of gene expression biomarkers that define the early aberrant immune activation. Thus, the primary objective was to apply these gene expression biomarkers to distinguish patients with sepsis from those who had undergone major open surgery and had clinical outcomes consistent with systemic inflammation due to physical trauma and wound healing."

The increase of research work in this area is due to both the growing digitalization in health care and the increased appreciation of the importance of early sepsis detection and intervention. To be able to understand the variety of systems and their characteristics as well as performances, a systematic literature review is required. Existing reviews on this topic follow a rather restrictive searching methodology or they are outdated. As much progress has been made during the last 5 years, an updated review is needed to be able to keep track of current developments in this area of research. Objectives To provide an overview about current approaches for the design of clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) in the context of SIRS, sepsis, and septic shock, and to categorize and compare existing approaches. Methods A systematic literature review was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Searches for eligible articles were conducted on five electronic bibliographic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, Embase, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. Initial results were screened independently by two reviewers based on clearly defined eligibility criteria. A backward as well as an updated search enriched the initial results. Data were extracted from included articles and presented in a standardized way. Articles were classified into predefined categories according to characteristics extracted previously. The classification was performed according to the following categories: clinical setting including patient population and mono- or multicentric study, support type of the system such as prediction or detection, systems characteristics such as knowledge- or data-driven algorithms used, evaluation of methodology, and results including ground truth definition, sensitivity, and specificity. All results were assessed qualitatively by two reviewers. Results The search resulted in 2,373 articles out of which 55 results were identified as eligible. Over 80% of the articles describe monocentric studies. More than 50% include adult patients, and only four articles explicitly report the inclusion of pediatric patients. Patient recruitment often is very selective, which can be observed from highly varying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The task of disease detection is covered in 62% of the articles; prediction of upcoming conditions in 33%. Sepsis is covered in 67% of the articles, SIRS as sole entity in only 4%, whereas 27% focus on severe sepsis and/or septic shock. The most common combinations of categories ""algorithm used"" and ""support type"" are knowledge-based detection of sepsis and data-driven prediction of sepsis. In evaluations, manual chart review (38%) and diagnosis coding (29%) represent the most frequently used ground truth definitions; most studies present a sample size between 10,001 and 100,000 cases (31%) and performances highly differ with only five articles presenting sensitivities and specificities above 90%; four of them using knowledge-based rather than machine learning algorithms."

Today, sepsis is one of the leading causes of mortality among populations in intensive care units (ICUs). Sepsis is difficult to predict, diagnose, and treat, as it involves analyzing different sets of multivariate time-series, usually with problems of missing data, different sampling frequencies, and random noise. Here, we propose a new dynamic-behavior-based model, which we call a Temporal Probabilistic proFile (TPF), for classification and prediction tasks of multivariate time series. In the TPF method, the raw, time-stamped data are first abstracted into a series of higher-level, meaningful concepts, which hold over intervals characterizing time periods. We then discover frequently repeating temporal patterns within the data. Using the discovered patterns, we create a probabilistic distribution of the temporal patterns of the overall entity population, of each target class in it, and of each entity. We then exploit TPFs as meta-features to classify the time series of new entities, or to predict their outcome, by measuring their TPF distance, either to the aggregated TPF of each class, or to the individual TPFs of each of the entities, using negative cross entropy. Our experimental results on a large benchmark clinical data set show that TPFs improve sepsis prediction capabilities, and perform better than other machine learning approaches."

Achieving accurate prediction of sepsis detection moment based on bedside monitor data in the intensive care unit (ICU). A good clinical outcome is more probable when onset is suspected and treated on time, thus early insight of sepsis onset may save lives and reduce costs. Methodology. We present a novel approach for feature extraction, which focuses on the hypothesis that unstable patients are more prone to develop sepsis during ICU stay. These features are used in machine learning algorithms to provide a prediction of a patient's likelihood to develop sepsis during ICU stay, hours before it is diagnosed. Results. Five machine learning algorithms were implemented using R software packages. The algorithms were trained and tested with a set of 4 features which represent the variability in vital signs. These algorithms aimed to calculate a patient's probability to become septic within the next 4 hours, based on recordings from the last 8 hours. The best area under the curve (AUC) was achieved with Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial basis function, which was 88.38%. Conclusions. The high level of predictive accuracy along with the simplicity and availability of input variables present great potential if applied in ICUs. Variability of a patient's vital signs proves to be a good indicator of one's chance to become septic during ICU stay."

Specifically, we develop a multi-layer machine learning approach to analyze continuous, high-frequency data. We illustrate the capabilities of this approach for early identification of patients at risk of sepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection, using high-frequency (minute-by-minute) physiological data collected from bedside monitors. In our analysis of a cohort of 586 patients, the model obtained from analyzing the output of a previously developed sepsis prediction model resulted in improved outcomes. Specifically, the original model failed to predict 11.76 +/- 4.26% of sepsis patients earlier than Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, commonly used to identify patients at risk for rapid physiological deterioration resulting from sepsis. In contrast, the multi-layer model only failed to predict 3.21 +/- 3.11% of sepsis patients earlier than SIRS. In addition, sepsis patients were predicted on average 204.87 +/- 7.90 minutes earlier than SIRS criteria using the multi-layer model, which can potentially help reduce mortality and morbidity if implemented in the ICU."

Design: Retrospective cohort for algorithm derivation and validation, pre-post impact evaluation. Setting: Tertiary teaching hospital system in Philadelphia, PA. Patients: All non-ICU admissions; algorithm derivation July 2011 to June 2014 (n = 162,212); algorithm validation October to December 2015 (n = 10,448); silent versus alert comparison January 2016 to February 2017 (silent n = 22,280; alert n = 32,184). Interventions: A random-forest classifier, derived and validated using electronic health record data, was deployed both silently and later with an alert to notify clinical teams of sepsis prediction. Measurement and Main Result: Patients identified for training the algorithm were required to have International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition codes for severe sepsis or septic shock and a positive blood culture during their hospital encounter with either a lactate greater than 2.2 mmol/L or a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. The algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity of 26% and specificity of 98%, with a positive predictive value of 29% and positive likelihood ratio of 13. The alert resulted in a small statistically significant increase in lactate testing and IV fluid administration. There was no significant difference in mortality, discharge disposition, or transfer to ICU, although there was a reduction in time-to-ICU transfer. Conclusions: Our machine learning algorithm can predict, with low sensitivity but high specificity, the impending occurrence of severe sepsis and septic shock. Algorithm-generated predictive alerts modestly impacted clinical measures. Next steps include describing clinical perception of this tool and optimizing algorithm design and delivery."

The inputs of the model include information about the patient sepsis, previous clinical records and treatment variables. The results show that high accuracy can be achieved and that the network is able to really map patients in two highly distinct groups of risk (survival and fatal outcome), under certain conditions."

Previous approaches have achieved high AUROC by learning from electronic health records where sepsis labels were defined automatically following established clinical criteria. We argue that the practice of incorporating the clinical criteria that are used to automatically define ground truth sepsis labels as features of severity scoring models is inherently circular and compromises the validity of the proposed approaches. We propose to create an independent ground truth for sepsis research by exploiting implicit knowledge of clinical practitioners via an electronic questionnaire which records attending physicians' daily judgements of patients' sepsis status. We show that despite its small size, our dataset allows to achieve state-of-the-art AUROC scores. An inspection of learned weights for standardized features of the linear model lets us infer potentially surprising feature contributions and allows to interpret seemingly counterintuitive findings."

This study will employ a richer data set that will expand the applicability of these models beyond intensive care units. Furthermore, we will circumvent several important limitations that have been found in the literature: (1) Model evaluations neglect the clinical consequences of a decision to start, or not start, an intervention for sepsis. (2) Models are evaluated shortly before sepsis onset without considering interventions already initiated. (3) Machine learning models are built on a restricted set of clinical parameters, which are not necessarily measured in all departments. (4) Model performance is limited by current knowledge of sepsis, as feature interactions and time dependencies are hard-coded into the model."

In this work we investigated the utility of high-resolution blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) times series dynamics for the early prediction of sepsis in patients from an urban, academic hospital, meeting the third international consensus definition of sepsis (sepsis-III) during their ICU admission. Using a multivariate modeling approach we found that HR and BP dynamics at multiple time-scales are independent predictors of sepsis, even after adjusting for commonly measured clinical values and patient demographics and comorbidities. Earlier recognition and diagnosis of sepsis has the potential to decrease sepsis-related morbidity and mortality through earlier initiation of treatment protocols. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.
